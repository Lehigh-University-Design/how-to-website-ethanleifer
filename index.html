    <h2>Tips</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        For extra flavor, consider adding chopped nuts like walnuts or pecans to
        the dough.
      </li>
      <li>
        You can use different types of chocolate chips or chunks, such as milk
        chocolate, dark chocolate, or white chocolate.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you prefer softer cookies, slightly under bake them by reducing the
        baking time.
      </li>
      <li>
        Store any leftover cookies in an airtight container to maintain their
        freshness.

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h4>
        Preheat the Oven:</h4>
        <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Line baking sheets
        with parchment paper to prevent sticking.
      </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>
        Cream the Butter and Sugars:</h4><p> In a large mixing bowl, beat the softened
        butter, granulated sugar, packed brown sugar, and vanilla extract
        together until the mixture is creamy and smooth.
     </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>
        Add Eggs:</h4><p> Beat in the eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each
        addition until the batter is well combined.
     </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>
        Combine Dry Ingredients:</h4><p> In a separate bowl, whisk together the
        all-purpose flour, baking soda, and salt. Gradually add this dry mixture
        to the wet mixture, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to
        overmix.
     </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>
        Add Chocolate Chips:</h4><p> Gently fold in the chocolate chips using a spatula
        or wooden spoon. Make sure the chocolate chips are evenly distributed
        throughout the dough.
     </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>
        Scoop the Dough: Use a cookie scoop or a spoon to drop rounded
        tablespoons of cookie dough onto the prepared baking sheets. Leave some
        space between the cookies to allow for spreading.
     </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>
        Bake the Cookies:</h4><p> Place the baking sheets in the preheated oven and bake
        for about 9 to 11 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown but the
        centers still look slightly soft. Remember that cookies will continue to
        bake a little after you take them out of the oven due to residual heat.
     </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>
        Cool and Enjoy:</h4><p> Remove the baking sheets from the oven and let the
        cookies cool on the sheets for a few minutes before transferring them to
        a wire rack to cool completely.
     </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>
        Serve:</h4><p> Once the cookies are completely cool, they are ready to be
        enjoyed! Serve with a glass of milk or your favorite beverage.
      </p>
